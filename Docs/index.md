# Singulink.Numerics.BigDecimal

## Overview

**BigDecimal** is a fully-featured decimal type that supports arbitrarily large precision values. It has all the mathematical operators, string conversions and parsing functionality (with full `NumberStyles` support) that you would expect from a complete implementation and performance has been highly optimized for values of all sizes. All operations are exact except for divisions which result in repeating decimals, and the behavior of all the methods is well documented so there are no surprises.

**Singulink.Numerics.BigDecimal** is part of the **Singulink Libraries** collection. Visit https://github.com/Singulink/ to see the full list of libraries available.

## Installation

The package is available on NuGet - simply install the `Singulink.Numerics.BigDecimal` package.

- .NET Core 2.0+
- .NET Framework 4.6.1+
- Mono 5.4+
- Xamarin.iOS 10.14+
- Xamarin.Android 8.0+

The package multitargets .NET Standard 2.1 for extra performance optimizations and .NET 7 for generic math support.
